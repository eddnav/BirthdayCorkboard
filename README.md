birthday-corkboard
==================

A simple birthday corkboard that shows birthdays as sticky notes. Uses MongoDB, Node.js and Angular.js.

Notes
-----

Every note is a custom element I made while learning Polymer, ie:

```<birthday-pinned-note day="26" name="Eduardo" noteoptions="{"background": "red",'animation': "drop-tilted-left"}"></birthday-pinned-note>```

Parameters
----------
**day**: the birthday, **name**: name of the birthday guy/gal, **noteoptions**: background, texture, animation and other stuff, doesn't have a vast array of possible choices for now, but it was really cool to learn.
